# kaggle-titanic
My ramblings and attempted solutions at Kaggle's Titanic contest.

Currently this notebook features:

* Some of the most popular engineered features, including: titles and surnames from names and 
family abroad and alone from number of siblings/spouses and parents/children.
Not all of those turned out to be useful, however.

* Filling missing ages using a GBRT.

* Final model using a Gradient Boosted Classifier.
